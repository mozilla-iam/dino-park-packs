Dear Mozillian,

You are receiving this email because you are part of an access group 
(mozillians.org/en-US/groups/) and your profile needs attention.

As we prepare to decommission mozillians.org in a couple of weeks, we have
finalized moving access groups data from mozillians.org to {domain}.

How does this impact you?

If you want to keep the access provided by the groups you're a member of,
you will need to create an account on {domain}.
To do this, please follow these steps:

1. Go to {domain}
2. Create and account by clicking the Log in/Sign up button
3. When logging in, use the login method that you generally use to single sign
on*
4. Change your username to something to your liking
5. Change your *email address* field level visibility settings from 'private'
to 'NDA'd' so that group curators can see who you are when they need to renew
your membership**
6. (Optional) To further ensure curators can verify your identity consider
changing the *first_name*/*last_name* field level visibility settings from
private to 'NDA'd or take other adjustments like sharing a profile picture.

Pro tip: If you need to configure an additional profile on {domain} (because
you currently have multiple mozillians.org identities), avoid being auto logged
in by the system by logging out on sso.mozilla.com first.

*It is important to note that in mozillians.org you were able to have multiple
identities linked to your account. This will not be possible in {domain}
anymore.

If you currently use multiple identities within the mozilla ecosystem and
you're experiencing problems, contact us on the #iam Slack channel so that we
can manually check your account.

**By failing to do so, you take the risk of showing as 'Anonymous user'
to curators of the access groups you're part of, who will not extend your
membership when it's due to expire.

Thank you,
The Mozilla IAM Team"
